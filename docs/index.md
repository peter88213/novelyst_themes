- To have a [wider choice](https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/themes.html), you may want to [install the ttkthemes package](https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Download and install

[Download the latest release (version 0.2.1)](https://github.com/peter88213/novelyst_themes/raw/main/dist/novelyst_themes_v0.2.1.zip)

- Unzip the downloaded zipfile "novelyst_themes_v0.2.1.zip" into a new folder.

### Note for Linux users

Please make sure that your Python3 installation has the *tkinter* module. On Ubuntu, for example, it is not available out of the box and must be installed via a separate package.
