# novelyst_themes

The [novelyst](https://peter88213.github.io/novelyst/) Python program helps authors organize novels.  

*novelyst_themes* is a plugin providing a theme changer dialog.

## Side note

Actually, the plugin is more intended for Linux, where the default theme looks pretty stale, and there are plenty of desktops, each with a different look.

On Windows, *novelyst* uses a lot of native widgets by default, you can hardly do better with custom themes.
However, if you want a dark theme, another plugin is good for that, which I included with the novelyst add-ons (*novelyst_awdark.py*). That also changes the colors of the tree entries. However, it must not be installed at the same time as this *novelyst_themes* plugin.

## Requirements

- [novelyst](https://peter88213.github.io/novelyst/) version 4.0+
- To have a [wider choice](https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/themes.html), you may want to [install the ttkthemes package](https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Download and install

[Download the latest release (version 4.0.2)](https://github.com/peter88213/novelyst_themes/raw/main/dist/novelyst_themes_v4.0.2.zip)

- Unzip the downloaded zipfile "novelyst_themes_v4.0.2.zip" into a new folder.
- Move into this new folder and launch **setup.pyw**. This installs the plugin for the local user.

## Usage

Start the theme changer from the main menu: **Tools > Theme Changer**.
